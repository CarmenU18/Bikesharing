## Results

- A total of 2,344,224 trips were analyzed and 65% of these trips were made by men.
Of the total number of trips made by men, 90% were made by subscribers, compared to only 84% in the case of women.

Now that we know the composition of the customers, it is necessary to know the behavior.

- The average travel time is about 5 minutes. In the following graph it can be seen that at the 5th minute of travel we find the highest peak travel ~ 146k. From the 30th minute onwards it is indistinct if the trip lasts longer, the number of trips does not increase.

- When comparing the times between men and women, it is observed that the average time increases by one minute to 6 minutes in the case of women:

Now that we know the distribution and behavior of customers, it is necessary to know at what times there is a greater influx of people.

- As it is clear in the following graph, the hours with the highest influx of people are from 8 - 9 AM and 4 - 7 PM.

The question now would be, what day of the week do we have the greatest influx of people?

- According to the data, the day with the highest number of trips is Thursday, followed by Saturday and Sunday. The difference on weekends is that there is a slightly constant flow from 10 AM to 7 PM.

- This scheduling behavior is observed in both men and women:

Finally, let's identify the type of user on travel behavior. The following image shows that the usage trend is similar, there is no difference by gender or type of user, but it is clear that subscription is the most common type of use for bicycle trips.

## Summary

- There are more male clients than female customers.
- The average travel time by bicycle is about 5 minutes.
- The weekday peak hours are concentrated in the hours when most people commute from home to work or from work to home, i.e., 8-9 and 16-19 hrs.
- The days with the highest number of users are Thursdays and Saturdays.
- The subscription-based service is the one most used by customers.
- With the knowledge of how the use of bicycles in the city works, it is necessary to know which bicycles have a higher use in order to focus on them and to refurbish or replace them in a timely manner.
